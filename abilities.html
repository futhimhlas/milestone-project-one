        <p class="heading-subtext">Every champion in League of Legends has a unique passive, 3 basic abilities and 1 ultimate ability. In this guide basic abilities
            are bound to Q, W and E whilst Lucian's ultimate ability is bound to R. As Lucian is marksman he can normally fill either the mid or adc role. He splits 
            from general adc philosophy as to generate maximum DPS with him, players will have to weave his spells in between his passive - Lightslinger. </p>

                            <p>Cast on a target within Lucian's auto attack-range, he fires a bolt of light which pierces his target and hits those a short distance behind it</p>

                            <p>After a brief channel, Lucian fires a cross shaped projectile that expands at the end of its range. Enemies hit by this are marked with light and if Lucian attacks
                            an enemy marked with light he will momentarily gain a small amount of movement speed (Great for kiting)</p>

                            <p>Lucian dashes towards the cursor upon activation of Relentless Pursuit. The cooldown of this ability is lowered by 2 seconds for 
                            every shot of his double shot landed whilst this ability is on cooldown</p>

                            <p>Lucian fully unleashes his weapons, firing continously in a straight line, damaging the first target hit in his extended range. His direction of attack is fixed whilst 
                            channeling this ability.</p>
