# Milestone Project One: Mini Champion guide
In this project, I hope to display the skills I have learnt so far in coding appealing and eye-catching websites using HTML and CSS. 
League of Legends is one of the biggest MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) games around with 151 unique champions to currently pick and choose from.
The purpose of my project is to give insight and indepth knowledge of one of those champions, Lucian. Lucian has one of the biggest skill gaps when comparing new 
and experienced players, the main goal of my website is to help bridge that gap.

## UX
One thing all champions have in common is 3 basic abilites and 1 ultimate ability bound to 4 separate keys (usually QWER) that have varying cooldowns after use.
Champs can also have multiple passive effects which can make learning a champion's combos and playstyle quite daunting. 

My goal as owner of the webpage is to help newer players understand the champion Lucian, by learning his combos and his strengths.

Users are league of Legends players looking to increase their knowledge and skill level in regards to playing Lucian.

Main features to include are:
* A full page background showcasing Lucian's 'Splashart' (As league of legends has a very capable and talented artwork team)
* An interactive 3d image carousel used to navigate to different pages within my site (Bonus feature)
* Embed video from YouTube with controls added so video can be paused and started (The video will show gameplay of Lucian and using his abilities)
